            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The <strong>Total Fertility Rate (TFR)</strong>, commonly expressed as children per woman, is a foundational demographic indicator that is critically important for comparing population dynamics and socioeconomic development across countries and regions. The TFR represents the average number of children a woman would have over her lifetime if she experienced the age-specific fertility rates observed in a given year. This makes it an intuitive and powerful tool for global and regional analysis.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Why TFR Matters</h3>
            
            <h4>📈 Benchmarking Population Change</h4>
            <p>
                The TFR is the primary factor determining a country's future population size and age structure. Comparing the TFR to the replacement level (approximately 2.1 children per woman) immediately classifies a nation as having a growing (above 2.1), shrinking (below 2.1), or stable population (at 2.1, assuming zero net migration).
            </p>
            
            <h4>🌍 Highlighting Socioeconomic Disparities</h4>
            <p>
                Differences in TFR reveal significant socioeconomic gaps. Generally, higher TFRs are found in developing countries, correlating with lower levels of female education, limited access to contraception and reproductive health services, and high rates of child mortality. Conversely, lower TFRs in developed nations often indicate delayed childbearing, higher educational attainment, and greater female labor force participation.
            </p>
            
            <h4>🏛️ Informing Policy and Resource Allocation</h4>
            <p>
                Governments and international bodies use TFR comparisons to forecast future demands on services. High rates necessitate planning for investments in schools, child healthcare, and maternal care, while sustained low rates signal an impending aging population and the need to adjust policies for pensions, elder care, and workforce size.
